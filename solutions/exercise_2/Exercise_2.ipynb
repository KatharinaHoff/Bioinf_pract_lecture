    "    * Does the script contain code that should be executed in lines 1-6? What are the comment characters of python? *No, there is no code to executed in lines 1-6. Comment characters are `#` for single lines, and `\"\"\" \"\"\"` for multiple lines. Comments are ignored by the interpreter.*\n",
