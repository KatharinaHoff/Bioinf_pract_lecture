    "# Programming Languages for Bioinformatics\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common programming languages for bioinformatics are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Bash - fast and efficient file manipulation\n",
    " * Python - clear multi-purpose language, excellent math support, very easy to learn, increasingly popular for analysis of biological sequences, *BioPython*\n",
    " * Perl - scripting language, strong in string manipulation, sometimes for confusing for beginners, *traditionally* used in analysis of biological sequences, *BioPerl*\n",
    " * C++ - required for computationally expensive tasks, more difficult to learn\n",
    " * R - statistical programming language, also often used for solving specific bioinformatics problems with existing packages\n",
    " * Java - platform independence, more difficult to learn than scripting languages, but for some users easier to learn than C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has in my opinion advanced to a multi-purpose language. If you are able to master Python, you will be capable of analyzing biological sequence data, performing statistical analysis, visuzalizing data, using machine learning very efficiently, and more. In this class, we will therefore focus on learning how to use Python3, and how to apply it to problems in bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Be aware that there are major difference between Python3 and older Python standards! See e.g. https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation \n",
    "\n",
    "Skip over this section if you are working with JupyterHub, for now. This is only to provide you with the necessary information to work on an Ubuntu system. (Be aware that even though Python is platform independent, there are system-specific differences. I will not give support for Windows installation. We are also able to test and correct your code if you developed on Windows. Please use Unix for development if working outside of JupyterHub.)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Ubuntu, install python3, pip, and numpy with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "sudo apt-get update\n",
    "sudo apt-get upgrade\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-numpy \n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "(The first two lines will bring your system up to date prior installation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For using biopython, install via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "pip3 install biopython\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "If installation of biopython via pip fails because your system cannot access online repositories for package download (we observed this when Ubuntu is run as a virtual machine within Windows, and Windows runs a firewall), do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1)  Download the package sources from \\url{https://biopython.org/wiki/Download}, the file could be called \\texttt{biopython-1.72.tar.gz}.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2) Transfer the downloaded file to your computer.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3) Install from local file with pip:\n",
    "    `pip3 install --no-index --find-links=\"/tmp/tranferred_packages\" biopython`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For using doit, install via pip:\n",

    "# Modes for using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## JupyterNotebook\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to use Python. In the current course, we will in the beginning mostly use the JupyterNotebooks, which provide an excellent interface documentation and interactive code that you can modify to your liking to test how Python works. You are already familar with this mode from the Bash introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, call python3:\n",
    "\n",
    "![python_bash.jpg](python_bash.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode might be helpful for fast testing of syntax. It is usually not suitable for solving complex bioinformatics tasks in a reproducible way. However, if you use interactive mode, I recommend that you type commands in a Text file (e.g. name it make.doc) and copy/paste into the Python command prompt, instead of typing there, directly. This enables you to store and document your code in the most primitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to replicate your tasks and distribute the code as standalone software, later, organize your code in *scripts*. We strongly recommend that your python scripts have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    " * the header contains the path to python3 on your system (on JupyterHub, that's `#!/opt/conda/bin/python3`, on most other Unix systems the actual path to python3 will be located with the directive `#!/usr/bin/env python3`); this tells your system to use the version of python3 that is found in your `PATH` (this statement is not required for *module files* associated with your main script)\n",
    " * file ending should be `.py`\n",
    " * file contains code in python3\n",
    " \n",
    "Sidenote: remember, the `PATH` is the location where Unix systems look for binaries, i.e. executable python scripts! It's a collection of directories. You can manipulate that collection of directories if you want to!\n",
    "\n",
    "You find a Python script `hello_world.py` in the directory of this JupyterNotebook. Doubleclick the file and inspect contents. The functionality of the script is trivial. It will print the string \"Hello world\". Next, we will make this script executable and execute it. First, we do this from within the JupyterNotebook:"
